    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
      <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified
        by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
        and are accessible over the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser.
        English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
        He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3]
        The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991
        and then to the general public in August 1991.</p>
